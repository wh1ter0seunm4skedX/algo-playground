# Algo Playground

**Algo Playground** is a project that provides implementations and visualizations of various algorithms, particularly focused on graph algorithms. The goal is to offer hands-on demonstrations of different algorithmic techniques through code and visualizations, making it a fun playground for learning and exploring.

> **Work in Progress**: This project is still under development. More algorithms and features will be added over time.

## Project Structure

- **algorithms**: A collection of classical algorithms, starting with the Gale-Shapley algorithm.
- **graph_algorithms**: Contains graph-related algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and other graph traversal methods along with visualizations.
